You might be thinking, why Project SOS? My phone does the same thing - well, not exactly. The application on your phone gives you quick access to call the police - this could give away your position if youâ€™re in situation that you need to be quiet! Our app sends an alert to the authorities with your real-time location and description, as well as health information, so that you are able to get the help you need in a timely 
manner - and quietly. All with the click of the button, as opposed to a call. Moreover, you can send your SOS message to your desired numbers.

Safer. Smarter. SOS.

Note: The message doesn't get sent because the emulator does not have a SIM card.
